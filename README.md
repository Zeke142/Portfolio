- **DayTradeOS** — Market tracking system with strategy simulation and trade logging  
- **CreativeOS** — Content engine for creators and product builders  
- **JobSearchOS** — Suite of tools to automate the job hunt

## 🎯 What I'm Learning
I'm currently leveling up my technical skills to qualify for remote roles in tech and data. This includes:
- SQL + Excel dashboards  
- JavaScript + Tailwind CSS  
- Git/GitHub version control  
- Data storytelling through live projects

## 🚀 My Goal
By the end of this sprint, I’ll have a full portfolio that proves I'm hire-ready for roles in data, analytics, and frontend development.

Let’s build something that works.
