# Portfolio
A public portfolio to showcase my learn-to-hire journey in tech and data. Includes projects in SQL, Excel dashboards, Tailwind UI, and GitHub Pages deployments.

# 👋 Hi, I'm Troy

I'm a self-taught system builder exploring the intersection of automation, data, and modular design.

## 🔧 What I Build
- OS‑PowerShifter — a modular AI system for productivity, automation, and content creation
- RideWise — a real-time rideshare tracking and earnings optimization tool
- DayTradeOS — a market tracking system with strategy simulation and trade logging
- CreativeOS — a content engine for creators and product builders
- JobSearchOS — a suite of tools to automate the job hunt

## 🎯 What I'm Learning
Right now, I’m leveling up my technical skills to qualify for remote tech and data roles. This includes:
- SQL + Excel dashboards
- JavaScript + Tailwind CSS
- Git/GitHub version control
- Data storytelling through live projects

## 🚀 My Goal
By the end of this sprint, I’ll have a full portfolio that proves I'm hire-ready for roles in data, analytics, and frontend development.

Let’s build something that works.
